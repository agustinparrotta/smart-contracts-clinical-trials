# Application of Smart Contracts in Clinical Trials

This repository aims to contain the source code of a Dapp for managing clinical trials. It is part of my thesis for the Mechanical Engineering degree at Instituto Balseiro. The paper index is available [here](./documents/CT_Dapp_Parrotta_Agustin.pdf). If you would like to access the paper and the code, please feel free to contact me.
